%	Updated guidance on use of amssymb package
% v3.0 May 2015
%    Renamed to match the new package name
%    Version number matches mnras.cls
%    A few minor tweaks to wording
% v1.0 September 2013
%    Beta testing only - never publicly released
%    First version: a simple (ish) template for creating an MNRAS paper

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% Allow "Thomas van Noord" and "Simon de Laguarde" and alike to be sorted by "N" and "L" etc. in the bibliography.
% Write the name in the bibliography as "\VAN{Noord}{Van}{van} Noord, Thomas"
\DeclareRobustCommand{\VAN}[3]{#2}
\let\VANthebibliography\thebibliography
\def\thebibliography{\DeclareRobustCommand{\VAN}[3]{##3}\VANthebibliography}


%%%%% AUTHORS - PLACE YOUR OWN PACKAGES HERE %%%%%

% Only include extra packages if you really need them. Avoid using amssymb if newtxmath is enabled, as these packages can cause conflicts. newtxmatch covers the same math symbols while producing a consistent Times New Roman font. Common packages are:
\usepackage{graphicx}	% Including figure files
\usepackage{amsmath}	% Advanced maths commands
\usepackage{tikz}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%% AUTHORS - PLACE YOUR OWN COMMANDS HERE %%%%%

% Please keep new commands to a minimum, and use \newcommand not \def to avoid
% overwriting existing commands. Example:
%\newcommand{\pcm}{\,cm$^{-2}$}	% per cm-squared
\newcommand{\eep}{\ensuremath{\mathrm{EEP}}}
\newcommand{\feh}{\ensuremath{\mathrm{[Fe/H]}}}
\newcommand{\normal}{\mathcal{N}}
\newcommand{\uniform}{\mathcal{U}}
\renewcommand*{\vec}[1]{\boldsymbol{#1}}

\section{Introduction}

Here is an example citation in text \citet{Lyttle.Davies.ea2021} and in parentheses \citep{Lyttle.Davies.ea2021}.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Hierarchical Bayesian model}
\label{sec:hbm}

\begin{equation}
    p(\vec{\theta}, \phi \mid \vec{d}) \propto p(\vec{d} \mid \vec{\theta}) \, p(\vec{\theta} \mid \phi) \, p(\phi),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        p(\theta_i \mid \phi) &= \normal(Y_i \mid a_Y + b_Y Z_i, \sigma_Y^2) \, \normal(\alpha_i \mid \mu_\alpha, \sigma_\alpha^2) \\
        &\times p(\eep_i, M_i, \feh_i)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        p(\phi) &= \normal(a_Y \mid 0.247, 0.001) \, \uniform(b_Y \mid 0.0, 3.0) \\
        &\times \normal(\ln \sigma_Y \mid x.xx, x.xx) \, \uniform(\mu_\alpha \mid 1.5, 2.5) \\
        &\times \normal(\ln \sigma_\alpha \mid x.xx, x.xx)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\section*{Data Availability}
 
The inclusion of a Data Availability Statement is a requirement for articles published in MNRAS. Data Availability Statements provide a standardised format for readers to understand the availability of data underlying the research results described in the article. The statement may refer to original data generated in the course of the study or to third-party data analysed in the article. The statement should describe and provide means of access, where possible, by linking to the data or providing the required accession numbers for the relevant databases or DOIs.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% REFERENCES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The best way to enter references is to use BibTeX:

\bibliographystyle{mnras}
\bibliography{references} % if your bibtex file is called example.bib

% Alternatively you could enter them by hand, like this:
% This method is tedious and prone to error if you have lots of references
